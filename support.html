      <h1><u>Support The LNC!!!</u></h1>
      <p>If you enjoy the outdoors and sharing your love of nature with others, then you will definitely enjoy volunteering at the Louisville Nature Center! </p> 
      <p>There will be an Education Program VOLUNTEER TRAINING
on Sept 8, 2015, at 10:30am at LNC. The Louisville Nature Center needs volunteers to help with the education programs throughout the year. Volunteers must be over 18 and enjoy working with children and the outdoors. All volunteer times are prearranged.</p>

        <h1>Volunteer Training</h1>
        <p>At trainings, for new and experienced volunteers, we do an in-depth training session on one of our school programs as well as a general overview and information.
      The training session will include enrichment, perhaps a hike, and food! </p>
        <p>As a small way to show our appreciation of our volunteers, once a quarter we draw the name from those that have volunteered during that period, and that lucky volunteer will win a prize! Just put your name in the box each time you sign in at the office. </p>
        <p>The Louisville Nature Center offers nature programs to schools, scouts, and others interested in nature education. The only requirements to assist with our programs are that you have a love of nature and the ability to work with children, and sometimes adult groups. </p>
        <p><i>NOTE: The Nature Center also has the need for help with office work, cleaning, gardening and other jobs for which training is not required. </i></p>

      <h1>Being a LNC Volunteer Education Assistant is our most popular volunteer activity.</h1>
      <p>Volunteer Education Assistants work along with the LNC staff presenting nature programs and leading hikes through Beargrass Creek State Nature Preserve. Volunteers can give as much time as they would like in assisting with our education programs. We have school groups visiting almost every day of the week for our 2-hour program.  </p>
      <p>Our brief training program provides volunteers with all the information and knowledge to get started. No previous wildlife knowledge is required---just an interest in learning more about nature in general and in furthering the Louisville Nature Center's mission of providing nature education and encouraging stewardship in an urban forest. And 'refresher course' sessions are provided regularly for all of our volunteers. </p>
      <p>In addition to Volunteer Education Assistants, we often need assistance with greeting visitors at our special events and providing information about the Nature Center and the Beargrass Nature Preserve. If you enjoy meeting new people, please consider offering your talents to the Nature Center as a volunteer greeter. </p>
